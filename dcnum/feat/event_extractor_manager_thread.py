        Parameters
        ----------
        slot_states:
            This is an utf-8 shared array whose length defines how many slots
            are available. The extractor will only ever extract features
            from a labeled image for a slot with segmented data. A slot
            with slot segmented data means a value of "e" (for "task is
            with extractor"). After the extractor has finished feature
            extraction, the slot value will be set to "s" (for "task is
            with segmenter"), so that the segmenter can compute a new
            chunk of labels.
        slot_chunks:
            For each slot in `slot_states`, this shared array defines
            on which chunk in `image_data` the segmentation took place.
        fe_kwargs:
            Feature extraction keyword arguments. See
            :func:`.EventExtractor.get_init_kwargs` for more information.
        num_workers:
            Number of child threads or worker processes to use.
        debug:
            Whether to run in debugging mode which means more log
            messages and only one thread (`num_workers` has no effect).
